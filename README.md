# One Step Continuous Integration

This repository is *Work In Progress*.

This repository is built to support the examples of a talk in preparation.

The aim is to build a complete _build and deployment chain_ (build/test/reports/documentation/deployment).

The toolchain should be deployable with a single command.

A codebase is obviously needed to demonstrate the build chain.
It is available [https://github.com/PierreBtz/build-chain-demo](here).
